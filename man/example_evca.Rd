\usage{
example_evca(n_decisions = 3, n_models = 4, seed = 123,
  utility_range = c(0, 10))
}
\arguments{
\item{n_decisions}{Integer specifying number of decision alternatives (default: 3).
Must be positive. Represents the number of choices available to the decision maker.}

\item{n_models}{Integer specifying number of competing causal models (default: 4).
Must be positive. Represents the number of alternative theories about how
decisions affect outcomes.}

\item{seed}{Integer random seed for reproducibility (default: 123).
Use the same seed to generate identical datasets across function calls.}

\item{utility_range}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the range for
generating utility values (default: c(0, 10)). First element is minimum,
second is maximum. Additional utility is added to create model-specific
preferences.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{evca_result}{Output from compute_evca() function containing EVECA value and details.}
\item{model_utilities}{Matrix of model utilities with dimensions decisions x models.}
\item{model_probs}{Numeric vector of model probabilities that sum to 1.}
\item{decision_names}{Character vector of decision alternative names.}
\item{model_names}{Character vector of competing model names.}
}
\description{
Generates example data for decision problems with competing causal models
and runs a demonstration EVECA analysis. This function creates realistic
examples for testing and understanding EVECA in various modeling contexts.
Utilities are randomly generated with structure to ensure different models
favor different decisions, creating meaningful model ambiguity.
}
\details{
This function generates synthetic data with the following structure:
\enumerate{
\item Base utilities are drawn from uniform distribution over utility_range
\item Each model is assigned a "favored decision" that receives additional utility
\item Model probabilities are drawn from uniform distribution and normalized to sum to 1
}

The generated data creates realistic model ambiguity where:
\itemize{
\item Different models favor different decisions
\item EVECA will typically be positive (value to resolving ambiguity)
\item Results are reproducible when using the same seed
}

This function is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Learning how EVECA works
\item Testing visualization functions
\item Demonstrating the framework to others
\item Generating test data for development
}
}
\section{Warning}{

This function generates random data for demonstration purposes only.
Real applications should use actual utility estimates from data or expert judgment.

\examples{
# Example 1: Basic usage with default parameters
example_result <- example_evca()

# Print key results
cat("EVECA:", example_result$evca_result$evca, "\n")
optimal_idx <- example_result$evca_result$optimal_decision_bma
cat("Optimal decision:", example_result$decision_names[optimal_idx], "\n")

# View generated utilities
print(example_result$model_utilities)

# Example 2: Larger problem with more decisions and models
large_result <- example_evca(
  n_decisions = 5,
  n_models = 6,
  seed = 456
)
cat("EVECA for larger problem:", large_result$evca_result$evca, "\n")

# Example 3: Different utility range
scaled_result <- example_evca(
  utility_range = c(-10, 10),
  seed = 789
)
print(range(scaled_result$model_utilities))

# Example 4: Reproducibility check
result1 <- example_evca(seed = 100)
result2 <- example_evca(seed = 100)
identical(result1$model_utilities, result2$model_utilities) # Should be TRUE

# Example 5: Use generated data for visualization
ex <- example_evca()
plot_evca(ex$evca_result)
