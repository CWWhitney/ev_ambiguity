\title{Bayesian Model Averaging for Expected Utilities}
\usage{
bma_expected_utility(model_utilities, model_probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_utilities}{Matrix where rows are decisions and columns are models,
containing expected utilities for each decision under each model.
Can also be a data frame that can be coerced to matrix. Each cell [i,j]
represents the expected utility of decision i if model j is true.}

\item{model_probs}{Numeric vector of posterior probabilities for each model.
Must have length equal to number of columns in model_utilities.
Must be non-negative and sum to 1 (within 1e-10 tolerance).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of BMA expected utilities for each decision,
with length equal to nrow(model_utilities). Each element represents
the expected utility of that decision averaged across all models
weighted by model probabilities.
}
\description{
Computes Bayesian model average expected utilities across competing causal
models. This function calculates the weighted average of utilities where
weights are the posterior probabilities of each model being correct.
}
\details{
Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) provides a coherent framework for making
decisions under model uncertainty. For each decision d, the BMA expected
utility is calculated as:

EU_BMA(d) = sum over all models k of: P(M_k) * EU(d|M_k)

where P(M_k) is the probability that model k is correct and EU(d|M_k)
is the expected utility of decision d given model k.

This function uses efficient matrix multiplication: model_utilities \%*\% model_probs

Computational complexity is O(D × M) where D is the number of decisions
and M is the number of models.

\section{Warning}{

This is an internal function used by compute_evca(). While exported for
flexibility, most users should use compute_evca() instead.

Model probabilities are validated in a specific order:
\enumerate{
\item Non-negative values
\item Sum to 1
Ensure probabilities meet the first constraint before checking the second.
}

\examples{
# Example 1: Simple case with 2 decisions and 2 models
model_utilities <- matrix(
  c(
    10, 5, # Decision 1: utility 10 under M1, 5 under M2
    6, 9
  ), # Decision 2: utility 6 under M1, 9 under M2
  nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE
)
model_probs <- c(0.5, 0.5) # Equal probability for both models

bma_eu <- bma_expected_utility(model_utilities, model_probs)
print(bma_eu) # Should be c(7.5, 7.5)

# Example 2: Unequal model probabilities
model_probs_unequal <- c(0.7, 0.3)
bma_eu_unequal <- bma_expected_utility(model_utilities, model_probs_unequal)
print(bma_eu_unequal) # Decision 1: 0.7*10 + 0.3*5 = 8.5
# Decision 2: 0.7*6 + 0.3*9 = 6.9

# Example 3: Larger example with 3 decisions and 4 models
model_utilities_large <- matrix(
  c(
    8, 6, 9, 7,
    7, 9, 5, 8,
    10, 7, 6, 9
  ),
  nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE
)
model_probs_large <- c(0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2)

bma_eu_large <- bma_expected_utility(model_utilities_large, model_probs_large)
print(bma_eu_large)

# Example 4: Using with data frame input
utility_df <- data.frame(
  Model1 = c(10, 6),
  Model2 = c(5, 9)
)
bma_eu_df <- bma_expected_utility(utility_df, c(0.5, 0.5))
