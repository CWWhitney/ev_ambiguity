\title{Bayesian Model Averaging for Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity}
\usage{
bma_expected_utility(model_utilities, model_probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_utilities}{Matrix where rows are decisions and columns are models,
containing expected utilities for each decision under each model.
Can also be a data frame that can be coerced to matrix.}

\item{model_probs}{Numeric vector of posterior probabilities for each model.
Must sum to 1 (within floating point tolerance).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of BMA expected utilities for each decision,
with length equal to \code{nrow(model_utilities)}.
}
\description{
Helper function for computing Bayesian model average expected utilities.
Used internally by \code{compute_evca()}.
}

# Example with 3 decisions and 4 models
