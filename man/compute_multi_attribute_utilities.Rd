\title{Compute Multi-Attribute Utilities}
\usage{
compute_multi_attribute_utilities(model_outcomes, outcome_weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_outcomes}{3-dimensional array with dimensions: decisions x models x outcomes.
Each element [i,j,k] represents the value of outcome k for decision i
under model j. All values should be on comparable scales or pre-normalized.}

\item{outcome_weights}{Numeric vector of weights for multi-attribute utility function.
Must be non-negative, sum to 1, and have length equal to the number of
outcome dimensions (third dimension of model_outcomes).}
}
\value{
Matrix of utilities with dimensions: decisions x models.
Each element [i,j] represents the aggregated utility of decision i
under model j, computed as the weighted sum of outcomes.
}
\description{
Computes single utility values from multi-dimensional outcomes using
a weighted linear combination. This function aggregates multiple outcome
dimensions into a single utility measure based on user-specified weights.
}
\details{
This function implements a simple additive multi-attribute utility function:

U(d,m) = sum over outcomes k of: w_k * outcome_k(d,m)

where:
\itemize{
\item U(d,m) is the utility of decision d under model m
\item w_k is the weight for outcome k
\item outcome_k(d,m) is the value of outcome k for decision d under model m
}

This additive form assumes preferential independence among outcomes,
meaning the preference for levels of one outcome does not depend on
the levels of other outcomes.

For more complex preference structures (e.g., non-linear utility,
interactions between outcomes), users should compute utilities directly
rather than using this helper function.
}
\section{Warning}{

This is a helper function primarily used internally by example_evca_multidim().
While exported for flexibility, most users should use higher-level functions.

All outcomes should be scaled to comparable ranges or units. Mixing outcomes
on vastly different scales (e.g., dollars and proportions) without proper
scaling can lead to weights not having their intended effect.

# Example 1: Simple 2x2x2 case (2 decisions, 2 models, 2 outcomes)
outcomes <- array(
  c(
    # Decision 1, Model 1
    0.8, 0.3, # Outcome 1, Outcome 2
    # Decision 1, Model 2

    # Decision 2, Model 1
    0.4, 0.9, # Outcome 1, Outcome 2

# Equal weights
weights_equal <- c(0.5, 0.5)

# Example 2: Prioritize first outcome
weights_cost <- c(0.8, 0.2) # Prioritize cost over effectiveness

# Example 3: Three outcome dimensions

  dim = c(3, 2, 3),
  dimnames = list(
    paste("Decision", 1:3),

    c("Economic", "Social", "Environmental")

)

weights_3d <- c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2) # Triple bottom line
utilities_3d <- compute_multi_attribute_utilities(outcomes_3d, weights_3d)
