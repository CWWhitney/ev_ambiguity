\usage{
compute_evca(model_utilities, model_probs, utility_function = identity)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_utilities}{Matrix where rows are decisions and columns are models,
containing expected utilities for each decision under each model.
Can also be a data frame that can be coerced to matrix. Each cell [i,j]
represents the expected utility of decision i if model j is the true
causal model.}

\item{model_probs}{Numeric vector of posterior probabilities for each model.
Must have length equal to number of columns in model_utilities.
Must be non-negative and sum to 1 (within 1e-10 tolerance).}

\item{utility_function}{Function to apply to outcomes (default: identity).
If provided, will be applied to model_utilities assuming they represent
outcomes rather than utilities. Common examples include risk-averse
utility functions like exponential utility: function(x) -exp(-r*x).}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{bma_expected_utility}{Numeric vector of BMA expected utility for each decision.}
\item{optimal_decision_bma}{Integer index of optimal decision under BMA.}
\item{optimal_utility_bma}{Expected utility of optimal BMA decision.}
\item{optimal_decisions_per_model}{Integer vector of optimal decision under each model.}
\item{optimal_utilities_per_model}{Numeric vector of expected utility of optimal decision under each model.}
\item{perfect_info_expected_utility}{Expected utility with perfect information about which model is true.}
\item{evca}{Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity.}
\item{model_probs}{Original model probabilities (for reference).}
\item{n_decisions}{Number of decision alternatives.}
\item{n_models}{Number of competing causal models.}
}
\description{
Computes the Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity using Bayesian
model averaging framework. EVECA quantifies the maximum value of resolving
structural uncertainty about which causal model is correct among competing
alternatives.
}
\details{
The Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity (EVECA) extends traditional
value of information analysis to handle structural uncertainty. It quantifies
the value of definitively identifying the correct causal model.

EVECA is calculated as:
EVECA = E(max utility with perfect info) - max(E(utility under ambiguity))
= sum_k P(M_k) * max_d EU(d|M_k) - max_d sum_k P(M_k) * EU(d|M_k)

The first term represents expected utility if we knew which model is true
(we would choose the optimal decision for that model). The second term is
the expected utility of the optimal decision under current ambiguity using
Bayesian Model Averaging.

Interpretation:
\itemize{
\item EVECA = 0: No value to resolving ambiguity (same decision optimal under all models)
\item EVECA > 0: Value to identifying correct model (different models favor different decisions)
\item High EVECA: Research to identify correct model likely worthwhile
\item Low EVECA: Decision is robust across models; proceed without additional research
}

Computational complexity is O(D × M) where D is the number of decisions
and M is the number of models.

\section{Warning}{

Model probabilities must sum to exactly 1 (within 1e-10 tolerance).
All utility values should be on the same scale for meaningful comparison.
If using a utility function, ensure it preserves the preference ordering
and is appropriate for the decision context.

When comparing EVECA to research costs, ensure both are in the same units
(e.g., dollars, utility points).
