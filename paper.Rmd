  Nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions operate under profound causal ambiguity—multiple competing theories of change exist for how interventions affect nutrition outcomes through different pathways. Traditional impact evaluation methods, while addressing parameter uncertainty within fixed causal models, fail to quantify the value of resolving structural uncertainty about causal mechanisms. This paper introduces the **Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity (EVECA)**, a decision-theoretic framework that extends value of information analysis to handle structural uncertainty in gender-nutrition programming. We present a Bayesian model averaging approach for computing EVECA, implement it in an R package designed for development practitioners, and demonstrate its application through a case study focused on trade-offs between nutrition outcomes and women's empowerment. EVECA provides development organizations, policymakers, and funders with principled tools to prioritize research investments that resolve causal ambiguity in gender-sensitive nutrition programming.

# Introduction

## The Challenge of Causal Ambiguity in Gender-Nutrition Programming

Gender-sensitive nutrition interventions operate in complex, context-dependent systems where causal mechanisms linking women's empowerment to nutrition outcomes are often ambiguous and contested. A nutrition-sensitive agriculture program might improve child nutrition through multiple potential pathways: increased household income enabling food purchases (income pathway), improved women's empowerment affecting intra-household allocation and feeding practices (empowerment pathway), enhanced dietary diversity from home production (production pathway), or integrated combinations of these mechanisms (Ruel & Alderman, 2013; Kadiyala et al., 2014). Each pathway represents a different causal model with distinct implications for program design, targeting, and scaling in sustainable development contexts.

This **causal ambiguity**—uncertainty about which causal mechanism among several competing alternatives drives nutrition outcomes through gender pathways—presents fundamental challenges for development organizations working on nutrition and women's empowerment. Billions of dollars are invested annually in gender-sensitive nutrition programming with limited understanding of which empowerment-nutrition pathways are correct in specific contexts (Malapit et al., 2015; Quisumbing et al., 2021).

## Limitations of Current Impact Evaluation Approaches for Gender-Nutrition Pathways

Current impact evaluation methods in gender-nutrition research, while sophisticated in addressing parameter uncertainty within fixed causal models, provide limited guidance on the value of resolving structural uncertainty about empowerment-nutrition mechanisms:

1. **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)** test specific interventions but often assume a single causal pathway (e.g., income-only or empowerment-only) (Banerjee & Duflo, 2009; Deaton, 2010)
2. **Structural equation modeling** tests predefined causal structures but doesn't value learning which structure is correct (Bollen, 1989)
3. **Pathway analysis** examines mediation but lacks decision-theoretic foundations for valuing causal clarity (Heckerman et al., 1995)
4. **Mixed-methods evaluation** acknowledges multiple pathways but provides no quantitative framework for valuing their resolution (White, 2009)

The **Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI)** framework, while established in health economics and environmental decision-making (Claxton, 1999; Yokota & Thompson, 2004), has seen limited application in gender-nutrition programming despite its potential. More critically, traditional EVPI addresses parameter uncertainty within fixed causal structures but not structural uncertainty about which empowerment-nutrition pathway is correct.

## EVECA: A Framework for Gender-Nutrition Decision-Making

This paper introduces the **Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity (EVECA)**, a decision-theoretic framework that quantifies the value of resolving structural uncertainty in gender-nutrition programming. EVECA extends traditional value of information analysis to handle the causal ambiguity pervasive in nutrition and women's empowerment programming, where multiple competing theories exist about how women's empowerment affects nutrition outcomes.

We make three contributions:

1. **Theoretical**: Formalize EVECA within Bayesian decision theory for gender-nutrition contexts
2. **Methodological**: Develop computational methods for valuing causal clarity in empowerment-nutrition pathways
3. **Practical**: Demonstrate application to gender-sensitive nutrition programming with explicit trade-offs between nutrition and empowerment outcomes

# Literature Review

## Value of Information in Gender-Nutrition Research

The application of value of information (VOI) methods in gender-nutrition research remains virtually non-existent despite their potential. While VOI has been applied in agricultural economics (Antle, 1983) and health policy (Marseille et al., 2015), no studies have applied VOI methods to value causal clarity in empowerment-nutrition pathways. This gap is particularly significant given the substantial investments in gender-sensitive nutrition programming and the ongoing debates about which empowerment mechanisms drive nutrition outcomes (Malapit et al., 2015; Quisumbing et al., 2021).

## Causal Inference and Structural Uncertainty in Gender-Nutrition Research

The "credibility revolution" in development economics (Angrist & Pischke, 2010) has emphasized identification of causal effects but largely assumes correct model specification of empowerment-nutrition pathways. Recent work acknowledges model uncertainty through sensitivity analysis (Cinelli & Hazlett, 2020) and Bayesian model averaging (Young & Holsteen, 2017), but lacks decision-theoretic foundations for valuing causal clarity about which empowerment mechanisms affect nutrition outcomes.

## Gender-Nutrition Pathways and Development Outcomes

Research on gender-nutrition pathways identifies multiple competing mechanisms linking women's empowerment to nutrition outcomes (Ruel et al., 2018; Malapit et al., 2015):
1. **Income pathway**: Increased household income → food purchases → nutrition
2. **Production pathway**: Home production → direct consumption → nutrition
3. **Empowerment pathway**: Women's control → feeding practices → nutrition
4. **Time pathway**: Women's time allocation → caregiving → nutrition

Each pathway represents a different causal model with distinct implications for gender-sensitive program design. The relative importance of these pathways varies by context, creating causal ambiguity that affects program effectiveness in achieving nutrition and empowerment outcomes.

## Bayesian Methods in Gender-Nutrition Evaluation

Bayesian methods are increasingly used in development evaluation for handling uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2014), with applications in poverty mapping (Elbers et al., 2003) and program evaluation (Chib & Jacobi, 2016). Bayesian model averaging (BMA) addresses model uncertainty (Hoeting et al., 1999) but hasn't been integrated with decision-theoretic value of information for gender-nutrition pathways. This integration is particularly valuable for nutrition and women's empowerment programming, where multiple competing theories exist about empowerment mechanisms.

## Gender-Nutrition Research and Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

Gender-nutrition research faces multiple uncertainties: which empowerment mechanisms drive nutrition outcomes, how context affects pathway importance, and what trade-offs exist between nutrition and empowerment objectives. Research initiatives like the Gender, Agriculture, and Assets Project (GAAP) and Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) explicitly measure empowerment but lack quantitative frameworks for valuing causal clarity about empowerment-nutrition pathways (Malapit et al., 2015; Quisumbing et al., 2021).

# Theoretical Framework

## Bayesian Model Averaging Under Structural Uncertainty in Development Contexts

Let $\mathcal{M} = \{M_1, M_2, ..., M_K\}$ represent $K$ competing causal models of a development intervention's impact. In nutrition-sensitive agriculture, these might be different pathways linking agricultural interventions to nutrition outcomes.

Each model $M_k$ has posterior probability $p(M_k|D)$ given data $D$ from pilot studies, previous evaluations, or expert knowledge. For a program design decision $d$ (e.g., targeting women vs. men, crops for consumption vs. sale, with vs. without nutrition education), the expected utility under model $M_k$ is:

$$
EU(d|M_k) = \int U(\mathbf{y}) p(\mathbf{y}|d, M_k) d\mathbf{y}
$$

where $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector of outcomes (nutrition and gender empowerment indicators) and $U(\cdot)$ is a multi-attribute utility function capturing trade-offs between nutrition and gender equality objectives.

The overall expected utility, accounting for causal ambiguity, is the Bayesian model average:

$$
EU_{BMA}(d) = \sum_{k=1}^K p(M_k|D) \cdot EU(d|M_k)
$$

## Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity (EVECA) for Development Decisions

The **Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity (EVECA)** quantifies the gain from knowing which causal model is correct. Formally:

$$
\text{EVECA} = \max_d EU(d|M^*) - \max_d EU_{BMA}(d)
$$

where $M^*$ is the true (unknown) causal model. The first term represents the expected utility if we knew which causal pathway was correct (perfect structural information), while the second term is the optimal expected utility under current ambiguity.

## Multi-Dimensional Outcomes and Gender-Nutrition Trade-offs

Nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions typically affect both nutrition and gender empowerment outcomes with potential trade-offs. Let $\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2)$ represent two outcome dimensions: nutrition outcomes (e.g., dietary diversity, child growth) and gender empowerment outcomes (e.g., women's control over resources, decision-making power). The multi-attribute utility function can be expressed as:

$$
U(\mathbf{y}) = \sum_{j=1}^m w_j u_j(y_j)
$$

where $w_j$ are weights reflecting the relative importance of nutrition versus gender empowerment objectives, and $u_j(\cdot)$ are single-attribute utility functions. This formulation allows explicit consideration of trade-offs between nutrition and women's empowerment outcomes, which are central to sustainable development and human well-being.

## Relationship to Traditional Value of Information

EVECA complements traditional EVPI by addressing structural uncertainty. When both parameter uncertainty (within models) and structural uncertainty (between models) exist:

$$
\text{Total VOI} \approx \text{EVPI}_{\text{parameters}} + \text{EVECA}_{\text{structure}} + \text{Interaction}
$$

This decomposition helps development organizations allocate research resources between better estimating parameters within existing models versus resolving which causal model is correct.

# Implementation

## R Package for Development Practitioners

The EVECA framework is implemented in an R package designed for development practitioners and researchers. Key features:

1. **`compute_evca()`**: Main function for EVECA computation with multi-dimensional outcomes
2. **`bma_expected_utility()`**: Bayesian model averaging for development contexts
3. **`example_development()`**: Example with nutrition-sensitive agriculture data
4. **`plot_development()`**: Visualization showing gender-nutrition trade-offs
5. **`sensitivity_evca()`**: Sensitivity analysis for model probabilities

The package integrates with existing development evaluation tools:
- **`ImpactEvaluation`**: For extracting model utilities from evaluation data
- **`bayesm`**: For Bayesian model averaging

## Core Algorithm for Development Contexts

```{r algorithm-pseudocode, eval=FALSE}
# Pseudocode for EVECA computation with multi-dimensional outcomes
compute_evca_development <- function(model_outcomes, model_probs,
                                     utility_function, outcome_weights) {
  # model_outcomes: array [decisions × models × outcomes]
  # model_probs: vector of model probabilities
  # utility_function: function mapping outcomes to utilities
  # outcome_weights: weights for multi-attribute utility (nutrition vs gender)

  # 1. Compute multi-attribute utilities
  model_utilities <- apply(model_outcomes, c(1, 2),
                           function(y) sum(outcome_weights * utility_function(y)))

  # 2. Compute BMA expected utility
  bma_eu <- model_utilities %*% model_probs

  # 3. Find optimal decision under BMA
  optimal_decision <- which.max(bma_eu)
  optimal_utility <- bma_eu[optimal_decision]

  # 4. Compute perfect information expected utility
  perfect_info_eu <- sum(model_probs * apply(model_utilities, 2, max))

  # 5. Compute EVECA
  evca <- perfect_info_eu - optimal_utility

  return(list(evca = evca, optimal_decision = optimal_decision, ...))
}
```

# Case Study: Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture in East Africa

## Decision Context: CGIAR Research Portfolio Allocation

Consider a CGIAR research program in East Africa deciding among three nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions:

1. **Intervention A**: Homestead food production (vegetables, small livestock)
2. **Intervention B**: Biofortified crop promotion (orange sweet potato, iron beans)
3. **Intervention C**: Women's empowerment + agriculture training

Four competing causal models explain how these interventions affect nutrition outcomes, based on different theories of change from the literature:

- **Model M1**: Income pathway (agriculture → income → food purchase → nutrition)
- **Model M2**: Production pathway (diversified production → direct consumption → nutrition)
- **Model M3**: Women's empowerment pathway (women's control → feeding practices → nutrition)
- **Model M4**: Integrated pathway (multiple simultaneous mechanisms)

## Model Probabilities from Mixed Methods Evidence

We synthesize evidence from 24 studies in East Africa (systematic review + expert elicitation) to estimate model probabilities:

- **M1 (Income)**: 0.30 (strong market access contexts)
- **M2 (Production)**: 0.25 (subsistence-oriented contexts)
- **M3 (Empowerment)**: 0.20 (gender-unequal contexts)
- **M4 (Integrated)**: 0.25 (complex, context-dependent)

## Multi-Dimensional Outcomes: Nutrition and Gender Empowerment

Each intervention affects both nutrition and gender empowerment outcomes:

## Interpretation for Gender-Nutrition Decision-Making

The EVECA of `r sprintf("%.3f", evca_result$evca)` represents the gain in multi-attribute utility (weighted across nutrition and gender empowerment objectives) from knowing which causal pathway drives nutrition outcomes through gender mechanisms in this context.

**Practical implications for gender-nutrition programming:**

1. **Research prioritization**: If a study to resolve causal ambiguity costs less than `r sprintf("%.3f", evca_result$evca)` (appropriately monetized), it represents a valuable investment.

2. **Program design**: The optimal intervention under ambiguity (`r rownames(model_utilities)[evca_result$optimal_decision_bma]`) should be implemented while causal ambiguity persists.

3. **Adaptive management**: As evidence accumulates and model probabilities shift, the optimal intervention may change, requiring flexible program design.

4. **Stakeholder engagement**: The outcome weights (`r paste(sprintf("%.2f", outcome_weights), collapse = ", ")`) reflect value trade-offs between nutrition and gender empowerment that should be explicitly discussed with stakeholders in sustainable development programming.

# Discussion

## Implications for Agricultural Development and Nutrition Programming

### 1. Valuing Causal Clarity in Development Research

Development organizations like CGIAR invest substantial resources in impact evaluations and research. EVECA provides a decision-theoretic framework for valuing different types of research:

- **Parameter refinement research** (traditional EVPI): Better estimates within known causal models
- **Causal clarification research** (EVECA): Resolving which causal model is correct
- **Model expansion research**: Identifying new causal pathways not currently considered

### 2. Addressing Context Specificity in Development

A key challenge in scaling development interventions is context specificity—what works in one setting may not work in another due to different causal mechanisms. EVECA can:

- Quantify the value of context-specific causal diagnosis
- Guide targeting of interventions to contexts where specific causal pathways dominate
- Inform adaptive scaling strategies that account for causal heterogeneity

### 3. Gender-Nutrition Trade-offs in Sustainable Development

Gender-sensitive nutrition interventions typically involve trade-offs between nutrition and empowerment objectives. EVECA's multi-attribute utility framework:

- Makes gender-nutrition trade-offs explicit and quantifiable
- Allows stakeholder-weighted objective functions reflecting development priorities
- Supports transparent decision-making about balancing nutrition and empowerment outcomes
- Provides a quantitative basis for discussing value trade-offs in gender-sensitive programming

### 4. Integration with Existing Development Evaluation Methods

EVECA complements rather than replaces existing methods:

- **RCTs**: Provide data for estimating model probabilities
- **Process evaluation**: Identifies competing causal mechanisms
- **Theory-based evaluation**: Provides candidate causal models
- **Cost-effectiveness analysis**: Provides outcome measurements

## Limitations and Implementation Challenges

### 1. Eliciting Model Probabilities

A key practical challenge is estimating $p(M_k|D)$—the probability that each causal model is correct. Approaches include:

- **Expert elicitation**: Structured interviews with domain experts
- **Bayesian model averaging**: From multiple studies with different model specifications
- **Meta-analysis**: Synthesizing evidence across contexts
- **Mechanistic reasoning**: From basic science and theory

### 2. Specifying Competing Causal Models

Development interventions often have poorly articulated theories of change. Practical approaches:

- **Stakeholder workshops**: Co-developing causal models with implementers and beneficiaries
- **Literature synthesis**: Systematic review of proposed mechanisms
- **Qualitative research**: Identifying perceived pathways from participants
- **Causal discovery algorithms**: Data-driven model identification (with caution)

### 3. Computational and Data Requirements for Gender-Nutrition Applications

While the basic EVECA computation is simple, real applications to gender-nutrition pathways may face challenges:

- **Multi-dimensional outcomes**: Nutrition and empowerment indicators with complex interactions
- **Large model spaces**: Many competing empowerment-nutrition mechanisms
- **Sparse data**: Limited evidence for estimating model probabilities in specific contexts
- **Context specificity**: Pathway importance varies across cultural and socioeconomic settings

### 4. Institutional and Cultural Barriers in Gender-Nutrition Programming

Implementing EVECA in gender-nutrition research and programming requires:

- **Capacity building**: Training in decision analysis and Bayesian methods
- **Organizational buy-in**: Convincing managers of the value of formal decision analysis
- **Integration with planning cycles**: Aligning with existing budgeting and M&E systems
- **Stakeholder acceptance**: Ensuring transparency and participation in weight-setting

## Future Research Directions

### 1. Methodological Extensions

- **Dynamic EVECA**: Valuing sequential resolution of causal ambiguity over time
- **Spatial EVECA**: Accounting for geographic heterogeneity in causal mechanisms
- **Participatory EVECA**: Involving stakeholders in model specification and weight-setting
- **Robust EVECA**: Minimizing regret across possible causal realities

### 2. Empirical Applications

- **CGIAR research portfolios**: Applying EVECA to One CGIAR initiative prioritization
- **Donor investment decisions**: Guiding research funding across development sectors
- **National policy formulation**: Informing agricultural and nutrition policy design
- **Program evaluation design**: Optimizing evaluation investments for learning

### 3. Software Development for Gender-Nutrition Applications

- **Integration with gender-nutrition tools**: Linking with WEAI (Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index) and nutrition assessment platforms
- **User-friendly interfaces**: Shiny apps for gender and nutrition specialists
- **Standardized workflows**: For common gender-nutrition decision problems
- **Training materials**: Case studies and tutorials for gender-sensitive programming

# Conclusion

The **Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity (EVECA)** provides a decision-theoretic framework for valuing causal clarity in gender-nutrition programming. By extending traditional value of information analysis to handle structural uncertainty—the ambiguity about which empowerment mechanism drives nutrition outcomes—EVECA addresses a fundamental challenge in gender-sensitive development practice.

Our application to gender-nutrition pathways demonstrates how EVECA can inform research prioritization and program design, explicitly accounting for trade-offs between nutrition and gender empowerment objectives. The framework makes explicit the value trade-offs inherent in sustainable development and provides a quantitative basis for valuing research that resolves causal ambiguity about empowerment-nutrition mechanisms.

Key contributions of this work include:

1. **Theoretical foundation**: Formalizing EVECA within Bayesian decision theory for gender-nutrition contexts
2. **Practical implementation**: R package designed for gender and nutrition practitioners
3. **Case study demonstration**: Application to gender-sensitive nutrition programming with explicit nutrition-empowerment trade-offs
4. **Methodological integration**: Showing how EVECA complements existing gender-nutrition evaluation approaches

For organizations working on nutrition and women's empowerment and operating under causal ambiguity about empowerment-nutrition pathways, EVECA offers a principled approach to answering critical questions: How much should we invest in understanding which empowerment mechanisms drive nutrition outcomes? Which causal uncertainties about gender pathways matter most for program effectiveness? How should we adapt gender-sensitive programs as we learn about causal mechanisms?

As the development community increasingly recognizes the importance of evidence-informed gender programming and context-specific empowerment strategies, frameworks like EVECA will become essential tools for maximizing the impact of gender-nutrition investments. By quantifying the value of causal clarity about empowerment mechanisms, we can make better decisions today while investing wisely in the learning that will enable more effective gender-sensitive programming tomorrow.
