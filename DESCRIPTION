Title: Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity
Version: 0.3.0
Description: Computes the Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity (EVECA),
    a decision-theoretic framework that quantifies the value of resolving
    structural uncertainty in decision problems with competing causal models.
    EVECA extends traditional value of information analysis to handle situations
    where multiple competing theories exist about how interventions affect outcomes.
    Uses Bayesian model averaging to integrate across model uncertainty and
    provides tools for research prioritization and decision-making under ambiguity.
