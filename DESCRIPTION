Title: Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity for Gender-Nutrition Decisions
Version: 0.2.0
Description: Computes the Expected Value of Eliminating Causal Ambiguity (EVECA),
    a decision-theoretic framework that quantifies the value of resolving
    structural uncertainty in gender-nutrition programming. EVECA extends
    traditional value of information analysis to handle causal ambiguity about
    which empowerment mechanism drives nutrition outcomes. Designed for gender
    and nutrition researchers, development practitioners, and policy analysts
    working on women's empowerment and nutrition outcomes in sustainable
    development contexts.
